# Example generators.yaml
# A .json schema for editor autocompletion is in ../support/generators_yaml_schema.json.

# The solution is used to generate a .ans for each generated .in which doesn't
# yet have a corresponding .ans. If there are generators that don't write a .ans
# file themselves, a solution must be specified.
# This should read the input from stdin and write to stdout.
#
# This must be the absolute path to the solution, starting in the problem root.
#
# TOOLING: may pick a default if not specified, but should raise a warning.
solution: /submissions/accepted/sol.py

# The visualizer is used when no suitable image was generated already.
# This should read `testcase.in` and/or `testcase.ans` from the current working
# directory, and write `testcase.ext` for an extension in:
# .png, .jpg, .svg
#
# This must be the absolute path, starting in the problem root.
#
# TOOLING: may provide a flag to make running this optional, as it can be slow
# and usually isn't required.

# the command being run.

# We support three types of generators:
# - Standalone files, like generators/a.cpp, generators/b.py, ..., which will
#   be compiled if required and run the same way as submissions.
# - Directories, like generators/gen containing files:
#   - generators/gen/tree.cpp
#   - generators/gen/lib.h
#   This will be compiled and run the same way as directory validators. Build
#   and run scripts may be used, as explained in ../spec/problem_package_format#programs.
# - 'implicit' generators whose dependencies are specified in the `generators:`
#   key below. The dependencies may refer to any files relative to generators/.
#   The generator will be built and run as if they formed a separate directory.
#   The first item in the list will be used as entry point.
#   E.g. the first example below would be equivalent to the two files
#   - generators/tree/tree.py
#   - generators/tree/lib.py
#
# For each generator name specified in a command to generate a .in
# file, we first check if this name is a key in the `generators:` dictionary below. If so,
# the corresponding generator is used. If not, we will use the generator with that
# file/directory name in the `generators/` directory directly.
