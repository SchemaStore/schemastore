The easiest way to build and send Discord messages with embeds using webhooks.\n\nThe embeds below explain a bit more, but you're not required to read them. If you're ready, click on the \"Clear All\" button in the editor to start making your own messages.\n\nDiscohook has [a support server](https://discohook.app/discord)! Feel free to join and ask any questions you may have, or suggest things you'd like to see.\n\nThere's also [a complementary bot](https://discohook.app/bot), it's completely optional but you may want it.\n_ _",

To do that it uses [webhooks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668), a Discord feature that lets any application send messages to a channel.\n\nTo send messages, you need a webhook URL, you can get one via the \"Integrations\" tab in your server's settings.\n\nNote that Discohook cannot respond to user interactions, it only sends messages when you tell it to. As such creating an automatic feed or custom commands is not possible with Discohook.",

Each of those will return formatting which you can copy into the editor to get the appropriate output.\n\nTo use Discord's default emojis, use its short name wrapped in colons. As an example, \"\\:eyes:\" will make the eyes emoji."
