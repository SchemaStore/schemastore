This role will not permit the user to create, change, or delete the instances. Similarly, the developer will permit a user to perform actions to see IP addresses of an Awesome Load Balancer instance, but not add, change, or delete the instances.\n* For the GoodRead system engineer role in their AwesomeCloud account, the system engineer role may only permit actions where the user can add, change, or delete instances for approved services (i.e. Awesome Compute Service, Awesome Load Balancer, et cetera). The role may not permit actions by the user for any other service.\n"
