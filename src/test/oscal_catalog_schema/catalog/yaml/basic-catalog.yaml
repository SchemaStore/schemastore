These responsibilities should be supplemented, where necessary, with more detailed guidance for specific sites and information processing facilities. Local responsibilities for the protection of assets and for carrying out specific security processes should be defined.

                    Many organizations appoint an information security manager to take overall responsibility for the development and implementation of information security and to support the identification of controls.

                    However, responsibility for resourcing and implementing the controls will often remain with individual managers. One common practice is to appoint an owner for each asset who then becomes responsible for its day-to-day protection.

                        1. policies for information dissemination and authorization, e.g. the need-to-know principle and information security levels and classification of information;

                        1. relevant legislation and any contractual obligations regarding limitation of access to data or services;
                        1. management of access rights in a distributed and networked environment which recognizes all types of connections available;
                        1. segregation of access control roles, e.g. access request, access authorization, access administration;
                        1. requirements for formal authorization of access requests;
                        1. requirements for periodic review of access rights;

                        1. changes in information labels that are initiated automatically by information processing facilities and those initiated at the discretion of a user;
                        1. changes in user permissions that are initiated automatically by the information system and those initiated by an administrator;

                        Two of the frequent principles directing the access control policy are:

                        1. Need-to-know: you are only granted access to the information you need to perform your tasks (different tasks/roles mean different need-to-know and hence different access profile);
                        1. Need-to-use: you are only granted access to the information processing facilities (IT equipment, applications, procedures, rooms) you need to perform your task/job/role.
