  ### These options control how "fleet apply" downloads the chart
  #
  # Use a custom location for the Helm chart. This can refer to any go-getter URL or
  # OCI registry based helm chart URL e.g. "oci://ghcr.io/fleetrepoci/guestbook".
  # This allows one to download charts from most any location.  Also know that
  # go-getter URL supports adding a digest to validate the download. If repo
  # is set below this field is the name of the chart to lookup
  chart: ./chart
  # A https URL to a Helm repo to download the chart from. It's typically easier
  # to just use `chart` field and refer to a tgz file.  If repo is used the
  # value of `chart` will be used as the chart name to lookup in the Helm repository.
  repo: https://charts.rancher.io
  # The version of the chart or semver constraint of the chart to find. If a constraint
  # is specified it is evaluated each time git changes.
  # The version also determines which chart to download from OCI registries.
  version: 0.1.0

    # exist on the targeted cluster
    variableName: global.fleet.clusterLabels.LABELNAME
    # It is possible to specify the keys and values as go template strings for
    # advanced templating needs. Most of the functions from the sprig templating
    # library are available. Note, if the functions output changes with every

    # The template context has following keys.
    # `.ClusterValues` are retrieved from target cluster's `spec.templateValues`
    # `.ClusterLabels` and `.ClusterAnnotations` are the labels and annotations in the cluster resource.
    # `.ClusterName` as the fleet's cluster resource name.
    # `.ClusterNamespace` as the namespace in which the cluster resource exists.
