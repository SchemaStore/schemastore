Both may be necessary.\n\nFor any given control, the Leveraged IaaS SSP must describe:\n\n1. HOW the IaaS is directly satisfying the control\n1. WHAT responsibilities are left for the Leveraging SaaS (or their customers) to implement.\n\n\nFor any given control, the Leveraging SaaS SSP must describe:\n\n1.
