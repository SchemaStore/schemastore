# via https://buf.build/docs/configuration/v2/buf-yaml

version: v2
# The v2 buf.yaml file specifies a local workspace, which consists of at least one module.
# The buf.yaml file should be placed at the root directory of the workspace, which
# should generally be the root of your source control repository.
modules:
  # Each module entry defines a path, which must be relative to the directory where the
  # buf.yaml is located. You can also specify files or directories to exclude from a module.
  # Directories across modules cannot overlap. For example, "a" and "a/b" cannot be two paths
  # to modules in a given workspace.
  - path: proto/foo
    # Modules can also optionally specify their Buf Schema Repository name if it exists.
    name: buf.build/acme/foo
  # Excluding a subdirectory and a specific .proto file. Note that the paths for exclusion
  # are relative to the buf.yaml file.
  - path: proto/bar
    name: buf.build/acme/bar
    excludes:
      - proto/bar/a
      - proto/bar/b/e.proto
    # A module can have its own lint and breaking configuration, which overrides the default
    # lint and breaking configuration in its entirety for that module. All values from the
    # default configuration are overridden and no rules are merged.
