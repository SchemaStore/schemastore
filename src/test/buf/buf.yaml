# Below is the output of `buf mod init --doc`, with `build:` commented-out.

# This specifies the configuration file version.
#
# This controls the configuration file layout, defaults, and lint/breaking
# rules and rule categories. Buf takes breaking changes seriously in
# all aspects, and none of these will ever change for a given version.
#
# The only valid versions are "v1beta1", "v1".
# This key is required.
version: v1

# name is the module name.
#name: buf.build/acme/weather

# build contains the options for builds.
#
# This affects the behavior of buf build, as well as the build behavior
# for source lint and breaking change rules.
#
# If you want to build all files in your repository, this section can be
# omitted.
#build:

# excludes is the list of directories to exclude.
#
# These directories will not be built or checked. If a directory is excluded,
# buf treats the directory as if it does not exist.
#
# All directory paths in exclude must be relative to the directory of
# your buf.yaml. Only directories can be specified, and all specified
# directories must within the root directory.
#excludes:
#  - foo
#  - bar/baz

# lint contains the options for lint rules.
lint:
  # use is the list of rule categories and ids to use for buf lint.
  #
  # Categories are sets of rule ids.
  # Run buf config ls-lint-rules --all to get a list of all rules.
  #
  # The union of the categories and ids will be used.
  #
  # The default is [DEFAULT].
  use:
    - DEFAULT

  # except is the list of rule ids or categories to remove from the use
  # list.
  #
  # This allows removal of specific rules from the union of rules derived
  # from the use list of categories and ids.
  #except:
  #  - ENUM_VALUE_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

  # ignore is the list of directories or files to ignore for all rules.

  #
  # This will result in this suffix being used instead of the default
  # "_UNSPECIFIED" suffix.

  # rpc_allow_same_request_response affects the behavior of the

  #
  # This will result in requests and responses being allowed to be the same
  # type for a single RPC.
  #rpc_allow_same_request_response: false

  # rpc_allow_google_protobuf_empty_requests affects the behavior of the
  # RPC_REQUEST_STANDARD_NAME and RPC_REQUEST_RESPONSE_UNIQUE rules.
  #
  # This will result in google.protobuf.Empty requests being ignored for
  # RPC_REQUEST_STANDARD_NAME, and google.protobuf.Empty requests being allowed
  # in multiple RPCs.
  #rpc_allow_google_protobuf_empty_requests: false

  # rpc_allow_google_protobuf_empty_responses affects the behavior of the

  # allowed in multiple RPCs.
  #rpc_allow_google_protobuf_empty_responses: false

  # service_suffix affects the behavior of the SERVICE_SUFFIX rule.
  #
  # This will result in this suffix being used instead of the default "Service"
  # suffix.
  #service_suffix: Service

  # allow_comment_ignores allows comment-driven ignores.
  #
  # If this option is set, leading comments can be added within Protobuf files
  # to ignore lint errors for certain components. If any line in a leading
  # comment starts with "buf:lint:ignore ID", then Buf will ignore lint errors
  # for this id. For example:
  #
  #   syntax = "proto3";
  #
  #   // buf:lint:ignore PACKAGE_LOWER_SNAKE_CASE
  #   // buf:lint:ignore PACKAGE_VERSION_SUFFIX
  #   package A;
  #
  # We do not recommend using this, as it allows individual engineers in a
  # large organization to decide on their own lint rule exceptions. However,
  # there are cases where this is necessarily, and we want users to be able to
  # make informed decisions, so we provide this as an opt-in.
  #allow_comment_ignores: false

# breaking contains the options for breaking rules.
breaking:
  # use is the list of rule categories and ids to use for
  # buf breaking.
  #
  # Categories are sets of rule ids.
  # Run buf config ls-breaking-rules --all to get a list of all rules.
  #
  # The union of the categories and ids will be used.
  #
  # As opposed to lint, where you may want to do more customization, with
  # breaking is is generally better to only choose one of the following
  # options:
  #
  # - [FILE]
  # - [PACKAGE]
  # - [WIRE]
  # - [WIRE_JSON]
  #
  # The default is [FILE], as done below.
  use:
    - FILE

  # except is the list of rule ids or categories to remove from the use
  # list.
  #
  # This allows removal of specific rules from the union of rules derived
  # from the use list of categories and ids.
  #
  # As opposed to lint, we generally recommend using one of the preconfigured
  # options. Removing specific rules from breaking change detection is an
  # advanced option.

  # ignore_unstable_packages results in ignoring packages with a last component

  # lint rule. The following forms will be ignored:
  #
  # - v\d+test.*
  # - v\d+(alpha|beta)\d+
  # - v\d+p\d+(alpha|beta)\d+
  #
  # For example, if this option is set, the following packages will be ignored:
