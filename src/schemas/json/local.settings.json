These key-value (string-string) pairs correspond to application settings in your function app in Azure, like AzureWebJobsStorage. Many triggers and bindings have a property that refers to a connection string app setting, like Connection for the Blob storage trigger. For these properties, you need an application setting defined in the Values array. See the subsequent table for a list of commonly used settings. Values must be strings and not JSON objects or arrays. Setting names can't include a colon (:) or a double underline (__). Double underline characters are reserved by the runtime, and the colon is reserved to support dependency injection.",
