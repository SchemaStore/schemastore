# Specification of the Semgrep rule YAML syntax using JSON schema.
#
# Note that even if most Semgrep users use YAML to write a rule, and not JSON,
# we still use a JSON tool (jsonschema) to specify the rule schema because
# YAML is a superset of JSON and can be mechanically translated into JSON;
# there is no yamlschema (see https://json-schema-everywhere.github.io/yaml).
# To add even more confusion, a jsonschema can actually be specified using
# YAML (like in in this file), and so one can use YAML syntax to specify the
# JSON schema of files actually written in YAML (hmmm).

#!!If you modify this file, update the submodules in semgrep and semgrep-app!!
