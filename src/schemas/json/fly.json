For anything else though, the `env` section provides a simple way to set environment variables. Here's an example:\n```toml\n[env]\n  LOG_LEVEL = \"debug\"\n  S3_BUCKET = \"my-bucket\"\n```",
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "build": {
      "description": "Build configuration options. See docs at https://fly.io/docs/reference/builders.",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "builder": {
          "description": "Builder Docker image to be used with the 'buildpacks' option",
          "type": "string"
        },
        "buildpacks": {
          "description": "Buildpacks to be run by the 'builder' Docker image",
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string",
            "minLength": 1
          },
          "uniqueItems": true,
          "minItems": 1
        },
        "args": {
          "description": "Build arguments passed to both Dockerfile and Buildpack builds. These arguments are **not available** on VMs at runtime.\n```toml\n[build.args]\n  USER = \"julieta\"\n  MODE = \"production\"\n```",
          "type": "array",
          "items": {

          }
        },

        },
        "image": {
          "description": "Docker image to be deployed (skips the build process)",
