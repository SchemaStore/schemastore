## Introduction

Welcome! Thank you for contributing to SchemaStore!

There are various ways you can contribute:

- Add a new JSON Schema
  - Local schema
  - Remote schema
- Enhance existing JSON schema
  - Fix typos
  - Fix incorrect schemas
  - Improving constraints within existing schemas
  - Add positive or negative tests for existing schemas

Most people want to add a new schema. For steps on how to do this, read the [How to add a new JSON Schema](#how-to-add-a-new-json-schema) section below.

If you want to contribute, but not sure what needs fixing, see the [help wanted](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and [good first issue](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc) labels on GitHub.

## Overview

Schema files are located in `src/schemas/json`. Each schema file has a corresponding entry in the [Schema Catalog](src/api/json/catalog.json). Each catalog entry has a `fileMatch` field. IDEs use this field to know which files the schema should be used for (in autocompletion).

Some schema files have associated positive and negative tests, located at `src/test` and `src/negative_test`, respectively. This repository has Grunt tasks that automatically load these files and use a validator (either [AJV](https://ajv.js.org) or [SchemaSafe](https://github.com/ExodusMovement/schemasafe)) to ensure that they either pass or fail validation.

There are three types of schema validation modes:

- [AJV](https://ajv.js.org) [strict mode](https://ajv.js.org/strict-mode.html): The default validation mode that is most stringent
- [AJV](https://ajv.js.org) non-strict mode: Some rules are relaxed for the sake of brevity. To validate under non-strict mode, add your schema to the `ajvNotStrictMode` field in [schema-validation.json](src/schema-validation.json)
- [SchemaSafe](https://github.com/ExodusMovement/schemasafe): Helps catch errors within schemas that would otherwise be missed. This is a WIP.

## Recommended Extensions

We highly recommend installing the following extensions for your IDE:

- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) to automatically configure editor settings
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) to automatically configure file formatting

If you are modifying JavaScript files, we also recommend:

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to automatically show JavaScript issues

## Troubleshooting

- There may be `git merge` conflicts in `catalog.json` because you added the item to the end of the list instead of alphabetically
- The `pre-commit` build server failed because the PR was created/push from an organization and not from your own account

## Best practices

‚úîÔ∏è **Use** the most recent JSON Schema version (specified by `$schema`) that's widely supported by editors and IDEs. Currently, the best supported version is `draft-07`. Later versions of JSON Schema are not recommended for use in SchemaStore until editor/IDE support improves for those versions.

‚úîÔ∏è **Use** [`base.json`][base] schema for `draft-07` and [`base-04.json`][base-04] for `draft-04` with some common types for all schemas.

:x: **Don't forget** add test files.

- Always be consistent across your schema: order properties and describe in the one style.
- Always use `$comment` to note about something to developers. You can refer to some issues here.
- Always use `title` when property type is an object to enhance editor experience which use
  this property to show errors (like VS Code). [Why](./editor-features.md)?
- Always use `description`, `type`, `additionalProperties`.
  - Always set `additionalProperties` to `false` until documentation permits
    additional properties explicitly. That tool the JSON schema is created for
    can be changed in the future to allow wrong extra properties.
- Always use `minLength`/`maxLength`/`pattern`/etc for property values.
- Don't end `title`/`description` values with colon.
- Always omit leading articles for `title`-s and trailing punctuation to make
  expected object values look more like types in programming languages. Also
  start `title`-s with a lowercase letter and try use nouns for titles instead of sentences.
- Always explicitly state whether some setting is global for some tool or local
  for a project created with this tool. For instance if some settings is local
  then add `for the current <project-type>` at the end of the `description` like
  `Whether to ignore a theme configuration for the current site` for `Jekyll`.
- Always add documentation url to descriptions when available in the following
  format: `<description>\n<url>` like `"Whether to ignore a theme configuration for the current site\nhttps://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#global-configuration"`.
- Don't add undocumented properties or features to the schema.

## How-to

### How to add a new JSON Schema

You may also want to read [Scott Addie](https://twitter.com/Scott_Addie)'s [**Community-Driven JSON Schemas in Visual Studio 2015**](https://scottaddie.com/2016/08/02/community-driven-json-schemas-in-visual-studio-2015) blog post on how to add a new JSON schema.

When uploading a new schema file, make sure it targets a file that is commonly used or has potential for broad uptake.

Be sure to keep a single source of truth. Do not copy an external schema here; instead, [point the catalog to the external schema](#how-to-add-a-schema-that-is-self-hosted).

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore
cd schemastore
```

Be sure that [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) is installed. The minimum required NodeJS version is defined by the `engines` key in [package.json](src/package.json). Now, install dependencies and run the `new_schema` Grunt task:

```sh
cd src
npm install
npm run grunt new_schema
```

You will be prompted for the name of the schema. Once you enter your schema name, the task will:

- Create a new schema file at `src/schemas/json/<schemaName>.json`
- Create a positive test file at `src/test/<schemaName>/<schemaName>.json`
- Print a string for you to add to the [Schema Catalog](src/api/json/catalog.json)

If you do not wish to use the `new_schema` Grunt task, the manual steps are listed below üëá

<details>

<summary>Manual Steps</summary>

1. Create a schema file in `src/schemas/json/<name>.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "$id": "https://json.schemastore.org/<schemaName>.json",
     "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
     "additionalProperties": true,
     "properties": {},
     "type": "object"
   }
   ```

2. Add positive test files at `src/test/<schemaName>/<testFile>`: (optional, but _strongly_ recommended)

   File extensions `.json`, `.toml`, `.yml`, and `.yaml` are supported.

3. Add negative test files at `src/negative_test/<schemaName>/<testFile>` (optional)

4. Register your schema (in alphabetical order) in the [schema catalog](src/api/json/catalog.json):

   ```json
   {
     "description": "Schema description",
     "fileMatch": ["list of well-known filenames matching schema"],
     "name": "Friendly schema name",
     "url": "https://json.schemastore.org/<schemaName>.json"
   }
   ```

</details>

Once you have created the schema and its associated testing files, you can run the Grunt task that validates that your schema is corect:

```sh
cd src
npm run grunt
```

To test a single schema, execute `npm run grunt -- --SchemaName=<schemaName.json>`.

If the task succeeds, your changes are valid and you can safely create a PR.

### How to add a schema with multiple versions

Refer to this [`agripparc` PR](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/pull/1950/files) as an example. First, your schema names should be postfixed with the version number.

- `src/schemas/json/agripparc-1.2.json`
- `src/schemas/json/agripparc-1.3.json`
- `src/schemas/json/agripparc-1.4.json`

Then, use the `versions` field to list each of them. Add the latest version to the `url` field:

```json
{
  "description": "JSON schema for the Agrippa config file",
  "fileMatch": [".agripparc.json", "agripparc.json"],
  "name": ".agripparc.json",
  "url": "https://json.schemastore.org/agripparc-1.4.json",
  "versions": {
    "1.2": "https://json.schemastore.org/agripparc-1.2.json",
    "1.3": "https://json.schemastore.org/agripparc-1.3.json",
    "1.4": "https://json.schemastore.org/agripparc-1.4.json"
  }
}
```

### How to add a schema that is self-hosted

You may wish to serve a schema from `https://json.schemastore.org/<schemaName>.json`, but keep the content of the schema file at a place you control (not this repository).

See [this PR](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/pull/1211/files) as an example. Simply register your schema in the [schema catalog](src/api/json/catalog.json), with the `url` field pointing to your schema file:

```json
{
  "name": "hydra.yml",
  "description": "ORY Hydra configuration file",
  "fileMatch": [
    "hydra.json",
    "hydra.yml",
    "hydra.yaml",
    "hydra.toml"
  ],
  "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ory/hydra/master/.schema/version.schema.json"
},
```

### How to move a schema from SchemaStore to somewhere that's self-hosted

Simply changing the `url` field in the schema catalog is not enough. You must also:

- Keep the original schema files in the repository and point to your schema with `$ref`
- Add an entry under `skiptest` so the remaining schema file isn't tested

See [this PR](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/pull/2421/files) for a full example.

### How to include a `$ref` to a SchemaStore schema

`$ref` from `schema_x.json` to `schema_y.json`

- Both schemas must exist [locally](src/schemas/json) in SchemaStore.
- Both schemas must have the same draft (example draft-07)
- `schema_y.json` must have `id` or `$id` with this value `"https://json.schemastore.org/schema_y.json"`
- In `schema_x.json`, add ref to `schema_y.json`: `"$ref": "https://json.schemastore.org/schema_y.json#..."`
- In [schema-validation.json](src/schema-validation.json), in `"options": []` list add
  `"schema_x.json": {"externalSchema": ["schema_y.json"]}`

### How to include a `$ref` to an external schema

This currently isn't possible. This is tracked by [issue #2731](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/issues/2731).
