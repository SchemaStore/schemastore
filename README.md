## Help us out

Keeping Schemastore.org running smoothly requires time, effort, and resources. While it’s still volunteer-driven, the infrastructure and maintenance costs have grown alongside its popularity.

And here’s the thing: for-profit organizations are among the biggest beneficiaries of Schemastore.org. They use the schemas to validate configurations, streamline workflows, and, ultimately, save time and money. If you’re part of such an organization - whether you’re contributing schemas or relying on them - I have a request: consider sponsoring Schemastore.org.

Your support would help cover hosting, maintenance, and development costs, ensuring this resource remains free and open for the entire community. It’s a small way to give back to something that likely saves you (and your team) time and effort every day.
